                <p>
                    I recently went to a hotel, which unfortunately did not have free wifi. However it did have paid
                    wifi. The wifi login page looked something like this. It had a place to put in the access code and
                    also a place to get one. The place we are going to be focusing on is the access code. Here, we are
                    looking to try and get wifi for free.</p>
                <h2 class="section-heading">Reconnaissance</h2>
                <p>The first step in the process of ethical hacking is reconnaissance. Reconnaissance is extremely
                    important. It’s the act of information gathering. This could mean things like what OS the server is
                    running, and other things. So, if we look at the url up top, we can go to the index of that webpage,
                    and even though we get a 401 response, we get something critical - At the bottom it shows us Red Hat
                    Linux, which tells us that the server is running linux.
                    Example for Apache:</p>

                     class="img-fluid" alt="">
                <h2 class="section-heading">Defining The problem</h2>
                <p>Just for this case, I’m going to create a webpage that can accept a code, and validates it. For the
                    purpose of this video, I’m going to print any error messages. The backend for this website is
                    written using Flask and SQlite, for the simplicity of this video. If you want to try it yourself,
                    you can do it <a href="https://github.com/vivek3141/sql-injection-demo">here</a>.</p>
                <h2 class="section-heading">Brute Force</h2>
                <p>The first thing that comes to mind would be to try every combination. However, this is definitely not
                    a valid option. In our case, we have a string with a length of 4, but in a real case, the code would
                    be 6 or mode characters. Let’s say we are using ASCII. The number of possible codes is 256^4, which
                    is about 4 billion. If each request takes a second to establish connection and send the form, which
                    takes over 136 years. In reality, if they were using 6 characters it would take about 9 hundred
                    thousand years. This makes trying every possible code not a valid option.</p>

                <h2 class="section-heading">SQL Injection</h2>
                <p>Let’s try to be a little bit more smart. This is how the structure of the program could look. We have
                    javascript and html on our browser, a flask api that connects to a SQL Database.</p>
                <p>But first of all, what is a database? Think of a database as being an excel spreadsheet. We can have
                    tables with rows and columns, and each of the columns have a name with the rows being the data. In
                    this case, we can have a database with all the codes possible, which could look like this. SQL is a
                    language that’s used for manipulating databases. It's incredibly popular, and our website uses it
                    too. Let’s go over a few SQL statements. The CREATE TABLE creates a table, like creating a
                    spreadsheet in excel or google sheets. Here, you can specify the names for all the columns and the
                    type of the data that goes in like INTEGER or TEXT. There is also something called private key. This
                    means that the field is always unique. The INSERT INTO statement allows us to insert data into our
                    database. We can make queries with the SELECT statement. This is the most important one for us. For
                    example, we can select all from a table. We can also select with some condition. In this case the
                    select statement for our website could look like this. This changes based on what is inputted in the
                    text field. The way we test for vulnerability is by entering the escape character ‘. You can see how
                    this statement would throw an error - The quote never completes itself. If the text is inputted into
                    the sql statement without any validation, we can manipulate the statement to always return
                    something. Such a SQL statement could look like this. (select * from data where 1= 1). If we could
                    get the SQL statement to look like this we would have successfully accomplished what we are trying
                    to do. If we insert something like this, it successfully completes the statement. Let’s say that it
                    could only be a number, the statement could look like this. Although we did this manually there are
                    a lot of great tools to do all the work for us. For the Kali Linux distribution, you can use SQLMAP
                    or SQLNinja to find which text fields are vulnerable, and perform the injection. There is also
                    another tool called JSQL Injection which can make automated SQL Injections. Keep In mind, do not do
                    this on any website in the real world, it is highly illegal. This video was for educational purposes
                    only. Be an ethical hacker not a cracker.</p>
