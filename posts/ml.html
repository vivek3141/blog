                <p>Machine Learning is used in almost every aspect of our technological life. You found this video
                    because of a machine learning algorithm that recommended it to you. Learning about it will help you
                    learn how machines learn, but more importantly it's an interesting topic. In this video, i'll be
                    going over some of the key concepts of machine learning, very quickly, so it’s important to pause
                    and think about it and also try it for yourself later on. The code i'm going to be going over uses a
                    python module I made, which you can find at the top of the description. I highly recommend using to
                    learn about the algorithms, then trying other modules for better usage. If you experience an error,
                    feel free to open an issue and I will try to resolve it ASAP. I’m assuming you have some coding
                    knowledge, and some mathematical background. If you want to learn python, I’ve left some great
                    tutorials in the description. All the code which is found in this video can also be found in the
                    description.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>So what *is* machine learning? By definition, it’s a way for machines to learn without being
                    explicitly programmed. For example, if you’re trying to predict if an image is a car or not, you’re
                    not telling your program to look for certain pixel values and use if statements to predict whether
                    it’s a car or not. You basically show your computer a bunch of images and it learns from those
                    images what cars look like. By the way, this process is called training, and the images and whether
                    it’s a car or not is called a dataset. It’s important to learn terminology, as when you look up help
                    on the internet, you are able to understand what is being told.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Broadly speaking, there are three types of machine learning - supervised learning, unsupervised
                    learning and reinforcement learning. I'll save reinforcement learning for another video. Supervised
                    learning is where the model is given a set of data to train on. Unsupervised learning models find
                    patterns and relationships in the data.</p>
                <p></p>
                <h2 class="section-heading">Supervised learning</h2>
                <p></p>
                <p> Supervised learning consists of regression and classification. Regression is predicting something
                    based on a few variables, like predicting the price of stocks, but classification is classifying
                    into defined groups, like classifying a picture as a car or not.</p>
                <p></p>
                <h3>Linear Regression</h3>
                <p>The first supervised learning model we’re going to be talking about is linear regression. If you’ve
                    ever taken an Algebra II class, you probably know what that is. But, let’s just go over it. Let’s
                    say you want to predict the price of petroleum based on the price of crude oil. You may gather some
                    sample data points, with the price of crude oil and the price of petroleum. If you plot them, it
                    looks like we could fit a line that would let us roughly predict the price of petroleum. </p>
                <img class="img-fluid"
                     src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vivek3141/ml/master/images/linear_regression.png">
                <p>But, how
                    would we do that? Let’s get some terminology out of the way. Our model, or out hypothesis, which
                    I’ll call $h(x)$ is defined as $0+1x$. $x_i$ and $y_i$ refer to the ith point in our
                    dataset. First, let's think about how we can calculate our error, or how bad our model is. We can
                    take the distance between our line and the actual point and average it over all data points. When
                    this is being done, we typically use a square rather than an absolute value, and you can find out
                    why <a href="https://youtu.be/CeBe2wLI8x0">here</a>. So, our error function, which is called a cost
                    function or $J(\Theta_0, \Theta_1)$, takes in 2 numbers for $Theta_0$ and $Theta_1$ and outputs a
                    number
                    that shows how bad our model is. The end goal is to minimize this function. People who have studied
                    calculus might get a ding in their head, and students who have studied multivariable calculus might
                    know that you could set the $\nabla J = 0$ and calculate the values. However, there are a few
                    minimizing algorithms that could be much more computationally efficient. Not to mention, calculating
                    the partial derivatives may not always be possible if $h(x)$ is a much more complex function. The
                    algorithm we’ll be using is called gradient descent. Basically, this is an algorithm that keeps
                    repeating itself, until it reaches a local minimum. The way it works is taking steps in a downward
                    direction until it reaches a local minimum. Using this algorithm we can get our values for $h(x)$.
                    The
                    learning rate is an important term. It describes how large the steps should be. Smaller steps could
                    result in very slow optimization, and larger steps could miss the minimum. Picking the right
                    learning rate is essential to getting a good model. There are many different minimizing algorithms,
                    which are far more complex, but those could be used too.</p>
                <img class="img-fluid" src="https://i.imgur.com/k26iY9Y.png">
                <p></p>
                <p>Now, let’s go over some code. First lets import out numpy library, which is used for doing operations
                    on matrices. Next, we’ll import the required module from the library to do linear regression. Let’s
                    randomly generate our data. What this is doing is randomly generating 50 data points from 0 to 1 and
                    multiplying by 10 to get random real numbers from 0 to 10, then converting to integer. And back to a
                    numpy array. Then, we’ll create an object of our class and call the fit function and set graph=True
                    to visualize the data. Here's the result. We can also run <code>l.predict()</code> to pass data
                    through our
                    hypothesis.</p>
                <code class="prettyprint">
                    import numpy as np<br>
                    from ml.linear_regression import LinearRegression<br>
                    # Randomly generating the data<br>
                    x = np.array(list(map(int, 10*np.random.random(50))))<br>
                    y = np.array(list(map(int, 10*np.random.random(50))))<br>
                    l = LinearRegression()<br>
                    l.fit(data=x, labels=y, graph=True)<br>
                </code>
                <p></p>
                <p>Regression doesn't have to be a line. We can do quadratic, cubic, quartic, exponential, logarithmic
                    or any function. It’s basically the same thing as linear regression, but instead of using a line, we
                    use another function.</p>
                <p>Let’s move on to classification. First I want to talk about activation functions, the most popular
                    activation function is the sigmoid function which is defined like this. What makes it special is the
                    fact that it’s always between 0 and 1.</p>
                <img src="https://i.imgur.com/tvA5vjN.jpg" class="img-fluid">
                <p></p>
                <p>The first classification algorithm I want to talk about is logistic regression. Imagine you want to
                    classify a flower as an Iris or not based on the size of the sepal and the size of the petal. Our
                    data would have two features for the sizes and 1 or 0 for our y based on if the flower is an iris or
                    not. Our hypothesis can look like $\sigma(\Theta_0 + \Theta_1 x_1 + \Theta_2 x_2)$. What the sigmoid
                    lets us do
                    is make our hypothesis output a probability of whether our flower is a Iris or not. We can set a
                    threshold, say 0.5 where if the hypothesis outputs above or equal to 0.5, its an Iris and if is
                    below 0.5 its not. Now, what we need to do is define our cost function. Then, we can use a
                    minimizing algorithm like gradient descent to get our model. Instead of Mean Squared Error, which is
                    what we used for linear regression, we will use something called cross entropy, which looks like
                    this. This is how we can define it. It’s defined as $-log(h(x))$ if y is 1 and $-log(1-h(x))$ if y
                    is 0.
                    This can be condensed to this. We can now use gradient descent to find the optimal values for
                    theta.</p>
                <p>Now, lets go over some code. First let’s import the required libraries. Then, we create our random
                    dataset, that can be split over the line $y=x$, after that we fit the model, and graph it. We can
                    also
                    test for accuracy.</p>
                <code class="prettyprint">
                    from ml.logistic_regression import LogisticRegression<br>
                    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt<br>
                    from ml.random import yx2features<br>
                    from ml.graph.lr import scatter_two_features, plot_line<br>
                    <br>
                    data, labels = yx2features()<br>
                    <br>
                    lr = LogisticRegression(features=2)<br>
                    lr.fit(data=data, labels=labels, graph=True, lr=0.01, steps=200, to_print=False)<br>
                    <br>
                    w, b = lr.get_values()
                    <br>
                    scatter_two_features(data, labels)<br>
                    plot_line(w, b)<br>
                    plt.show()<br>
                    <br>
                    lr.test(data=data, labels=labels)<br>
                </code>
                <p></p>
                <p>The next classifier I’m going to be going over is probably the most powerful one. You’ve probably
                    heard about it, it’s called a neural network. Basically, it tries to mimic a human brain by using
                    layers. You can learn the maths behind it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi">here</a>.
                    You don’t need to know the math behind it to use it but it does help a lot. A neural network takes
                    multiple inputs and can output multiple probabilities for different classes. Let’s say I want to
                    classify a handwritten digit. I would have a image and input the pixel values into the neural
                    network and output 10 different probabilities for each of the numbers from 0-9. Then I would select
                    the highest probability and say that it’s that certain number. The way a neural network ‘learns’ is
                    by looking at how wrong it was for each training example and adjust itself accordingly. We can use
                    several activation functions for the inner layers, but the most common these days is ReLu which
                    looks like this.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Now, let's build a handwritten digit classifier. First we import the required modules. Then, we
                    create the object, specifying how many neurons we want in the middle layers and our activation
                    function. Then, we can train it using out data, and then test it. We get an accuracy of about 92%,
                    which may not seem bad, but that 8% makes up for a large amount of error. We can do better.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>There are many different types of neural networks but the one I’m going to talk about now is a
                    convolutional neural network. This type of neural network is very effective on images, which is good
                    for our case. It uses a filtering method that makes it very effective. Let’s see how we can use it.
                    First, I’m going to import the modules, then make the object, setting a few constants. After that,
                    I’m going to train the model and test it. Based on how long we train it for, we can get an accuracy
                    of around 98%, which is way better.</p>
                <p></p>
                <h2 class="section-heading">Unsupervised learning</h2>
                <p></p>
                <p>Although there are many different unsupervised learning algorithms, I’m only going to cover one
                    today, that is K-Means. This is a clustering algorithm, that can cluster a dataset into K different
                    clusters, hence the name K-Means. It’s an iterative algorithm and not hard to wrap your head around,
                    so I’ve left some links below to learn about the maths behind this algorithm. Basically, you want to
                    use K-Means if you have an unlabelled dataset which you want to separate into different groups.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>In this example, I’m going to cluster a randomly generated dataset into 4 different groups, so K=4.
                    First let’s import the required modules, create the dataset, train and then graph.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>By the way, if you want to look at any of this code, feel free to go to the description, where I’ve
                    left a link where you can find all the code mentioned in this video.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>So, what’s next? A lot, actually. I’ve barely scraped the surface of machine learning. The goal of
                    this video was to give an overview of some popular algorithms in machine learning. It could show you
                    if you find this topic interesting or not. If you are interested, I recommend trying tensorflow, and
                    learning how exactly each of the algorithms mentioned work. You can also try various other
                    algorithms like SVMs Recurrent Neural Networks, LSTMs, etc. One field that I didn’t cover is
                    reinforcement learning, which I could make a video on. Reinforcement learning leads to a lot of the
                    major headlines you see on the news, like OpenAis Dota players and Google’s DeepMind projects.
                    That’s all I have for you know, thanks for watching!</p>
